Danmaku
-------

`draft` `optional`

This NIP defines a new kind of event, `2333`, for danmaku.

### Format

The format uses a regular event kind `2333`.

The `.content` of these events is the content of the danmaku comment.

The list of tags are as follows:
* `i` (required) universally unique identifier of the video. The format is `<platform (lowercase)>:<identity>` where `<platform>` is the platform of the video and `<identity>` is the unique identifier of the video on that platform. For example, a YouTube video with the identifier `aA-jiiepOrE` would have the identifier `youtube:aA-jiiepOrE`.
* `time` (required) the time of the video when the danmaku comment is sent in seconds.
